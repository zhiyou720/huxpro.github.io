### 10/02/2018 Outline
#### Themes

***Time***: Time is one of the most important element in data collection and transformation. We will use several kinds of sensors in this project. Thus, the time is a kind of essential data that we can collect. Using the time data to reflect some whimsical things must be interesting. For example, we will collect the visitors' dwell time when they appreciate every exhibit. These data will reflect the exhibits' emotion. In addition, every visitor's time data that they spend on different exhibits is unique. we can analyse these data to create some meaningful souvenirs.

***Engagement***: The audience’s engagement is cast as an essential dimension of assessing the quality of a visiting tour. In proportion to the degree in which an audience is engaged will probably be the degree of enjoyment they attain. Various factors are involved in the audience’s engagement during their visiting in a displaying space, including: the general environment and atmosphere of the space, their awareness of the meanings and values of the exhibits, their interests and expectations towards the exhibiting content,  and many others. Every factor can be further unpacked into separate ideas which will lead to detailed design approaches and ideals for an exhibition. In this case, we would like to go deep into establishing the emotional connection between the exhibits and the audiences to increase the odds of achieving a more desirable visiting experience.  

***Emotion***: Emotion is any conscious experience characterized by a certain degree of pleasure or displeasure, which is more related to human mental activities. When it comes to emotion, factors like happiness, sadness, temper, personality, humanlike and emotional trigger show up here. If ever we attached emotional feelings with the exhibits, it would help the audience feel more involved and empathetic, since we’ve offered possibilities for them to understand the objects from a humanlike view. 


#### Brief

In order to integrate three themes mentioned above together, we intend to create a exhibition stand which allows visitors to feel the exhibits’ emotion that  is shown by the lights installed in the exhibition stand. The more lamps that light up mean the happier the exhibit is.

There are sensors inside the exhibition stand which is set to control the light. Those sensors can feel how long the visitors stay with the exhibit. The longer the visitors look at the exhibit, the more lamps in the exhibition stand will light up. It means the exhibit can feel they are gazed and appreciated and it can make them happier. This is how we integrate the two themes: time and emotion. In addition, the sensors also have another function which is to detect visitors’ behaviour. As long as visitors do the specific action, like waving in front of the exhibit, the audio introduction of that exhibit will  start playing. This function is designed to increase the interaction between visitors and exhibits, making visitors feel more engaged and interesting.

At the meantime, in the visitors' audio guide, we will install a sensor to collect visitors data, such as their visiting  tracks. The sensor will also collect how long the visitor look at each exhibits and  find out their favourite one. With those data, we are able to create unique souvenir for every visitors utilizing 3D printing technology and so on.


#### Equipment and technical development 

- Materials:
  - Wooden board
  - LED lattice


- Sensors:  
  - Ultrasonic sensor
  - Infrared sensor
  - NFC tags

- Development tools:
  - Arduino
  - Python
  - Mysql

In order to collect data from visitors, we are going to use several kinds of sensors via arduino. For example, using ultrasonic sensors to identify whether a exhibit is being visited, and applying NFC tags to activate the exhibits’ audio introduction summarized from the Internet and provided data.

After collecting these data, we plan to analysis them and give each exhibit an emotion which comes from different kinds of data by python. For example, if a visitor are very close to an exhibit(distance data will be collected by sensors),  we can say it feels happy and design a program to make the led lighter.

Challenges and things need to be learn:
How can data be transmitted automatically?
Link of each step.

### 28/02/2018 First Tutor Meeting

- Tutor's thought about our project:
  - The timetable is unrealistic and it need to be rescheduled
  - The product should be practical and meaningful

- What we should do:
  -	Go to the museum and have a look
  - Do more research about exhibition or museum and collect relevant information.
  - Post our idea and relevant material in the blog.
  - Start thinking about the exhibition stand.

- Some inspiration:
  - We should collect our own data, but do not need to collect data inside the museum.
  - Consider that we may not be able to display inside the museum.
  - Refer to cycle counters and think about how people will use out product.
  - Try to be the object and think about how they feel. Find something stronger to support our emotion part.

- Next Meeting(Tuesday 6TH March 1:00pm in Evolution House, Mission should be done before the next meeting):
  - By that time, all research (visual, functional, interactive, emotional, exhibit, museum interaction) should be done.
  - Everyone should produce 2 concepts relevant to the original one before having a meeting to choose the best 3 concepts.

Besides, we should finish the prototype by 13th March.

### 06/03/2018 Second Tutor Meeting

- Two main concepts of our raw ideas:
  - Add passive interactions to the exhibit based on the visitors' behaviours
  - Create active interactions between the exhibit and the visitors to draw the attention of the audiences

- Some inspiration:
  - Probe into emotions and consider emotional responses towards interactions
  - Refer to  emotion flow chart and think about how to explore emotions with data
  - Think about why the visitor goes to the exhibits and how the visitor interacts with the exhibits

- Advice on the mission:
  - Don't let techniques constrain your ideas.
  - Narrow down to no more than 3 things to work on.
  - Begin to gather our data as soon as possible.

- Next Meeting: Tuesday, 13th March 1:00pm in Evolution House
  - We should post what we have been working on on our blog and sent it to the tutor before meeting.
  - We should finish a working prototype by 20th March.

- Schedule of this week: 
  - 6th-9th March: research on craft references and materials that are suitable for our work
  - 10th March: have a group discussion and finish the detailed design for the prototype
  - 12th March: finish a prototype that can be used for testing and gathering feedback
  
  
### 10/03/2018 Data inspiration(by Yongqian Lin)
  
After changing our idea, We find some relevant materials that might help:

Some relevant video about led:

- [how the light flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l09hAqXgKo)

- The effect is excellent, maybe we can use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bvWArORSc) in our exhibition stand design.

- The [instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3l-zJafOnc) might help


- [Excellent texture](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14171747/Lightining-furnitures)

- the [graphic design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/47820761/Cime-Centro-do-Exercicio) might inspire us

#### Research about relationship between color and emotion]

- I think the screenshot might be the most important of [this research](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=zh-CN&lr=&id=lCoAb9RDVIYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA31&dq=color+emotion&ots=PGeFySf4rF&sig=Fv5IsIcO9GPviy7W6DN8F6RJxck&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=color%20emotion&f=false), showing how people think of each colors.

### 11/03/2018 Group meeting(the improved idea)

After the discussion, we changed our original idea. We intend to fuse the LED lights that express emotions with the table where the exhibit is placed, and place various sensors inside the table to detect visitors' behavior. In this case, we can create a multi-functional display table.

The bottom left corner of the table is an LED light panel that directly expresses the feelings of the exhibits. This LED light will show the expression of the exhibits, such as smile, laugh, angry and so on. If the exhibit feels that someone is close to it, it will begin to shake its smiling face to attract the attention of the visitor. If the visitor stands in front of the exhibit, the LED lights will always keep smiling. However, when the audience tries to touch the exhibit by hand, the LED light will immediately turn into an angry expression, prompting the user not to touch it.

The table has a touchable area. After the visitor strongly press this area, the entire table will gradually light up. Since our desk is hollowed-out, a certain pattern (such as the pattern of branches) will appear after the lights are on. At this point, the sensor will detect how many viewers there are and to light some of the special patterns according to the number of viewers. When the special pattern is all lit, the LED lights at the bottom left corner of the table will become a laughing expression. This is because the more people watch this exhibit, the happier the exhibit will be. If the visitor loose his hand, these patterns will all be darkened. 

We tried to make the prototype in this afternoon:

### 12/03/2018 The visit of Georgian House

We visited the Georgian House to see how the exhibits are displayed.
We found out that it might be strange to put our exhibition desk inside this house. It might be better if we put our desk in the entrance or outside the house to attract the pedestrians.

### 13/03/2018 Group meeting

Tutor’s thought about our project:
- The QR code effect might be difficult to achieve
- We should think about how to design with data that we collect
- We should not be confined by technology

What we should do:
- Improve our idea to show the data we collect
- Think about what material we need and how to realize our idea

Some inspiration:
- Think about how to implement these effects with simple techniques
- Refer to Makey Makey, Projection Mapping, Processing. These technology can help us realize these effects.   

Next Meeting: Friday 16TH March (we need to confirm the specific time)
Missions should be done before the next meeting:
- Improve our idea!
	
Besides, we should finish the pro prototype by 20th March.

### 16/03/2018 Third Tutor Meeting

At the beginning of the meeting，we presented the improved idea of our exhibition desk to tutor.

Here is the improved idea:
There are two main parts of our exhibition table. One is the emotional display area and the other is the game area.
In the game area, we will set up some simple single choice questions related to the exhibits in the screen. Those questions have two options. The user selects the first option by pressing the press area on the left side of the screen and the second option by pressing the right side of the screen. After answering five questions, the user can get their marks.
In the exhibition area, there are line and circle patterns expressing the emotions of the exhibit and the LED panel which is to explain the correspondence between different colors and emotions.
After playing the game in our exhibition table, visitor can light a line and corresponding circle on the table, and their color changes according to the user's score.

After listening to our ideas, the tutor gave us the following suggestions:
- We should improve our idea to make the table more understandable so that every new visitor can understand exactly the implications behind the desk, what needs to be done and how to interact with the exhibit;
- Enhance the relationship between the game and digital visualization;
- We need to figure out what technique to use to achieve this effect.

### 17/03/2018 Group meeting

We decided the pattern to show exhibit’s emotion in the surface of the desk before created the second version of our prototype, making a brace for the display and game area.

### 20/03/2018 Prototype Feedback

Getting some feedbacks from classmates after the showing of our prototypes, we thought that are really helpful! However, we also ought to explain our product more clearly next time because some classmates didn’t understand our theme.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiyou720/zhiyou720.github.io/master/img/DWD/116.png)


### 21/03/2018 Group meeting

We had a group meeting to review our design plan after the prototype show and ordered necessary materials for the actual making process.

### 23/03/2018 Group meeting

Using the laser cutter to cut the card and gain the pattern we want. It was difficult for us because no one in our group know how to use the laser cutter. And It looks quite nice!

### 03/04/2018 Feedback from prototype show

In the prototype show on 3th April, teachers had the following questions and gave us some suggestions for our project:

1. Other people don’t know what the people playing our game are doing, besides, they don’t know what the lights represent.
2. The sensors have some problems. It is not very sensitive.
3. The relationship between the game and the lights is not clear, so visitors cannot understand what the lights represent. By the way, people who play the game will not look up at the lights.
4. There is a problem with the holographic height (they cannot see the exhibit).
5. 12 lights per round were mistaken for 12 questions
6.The position of the hand should be adjusted
7. they thinks that we require visitors to have a background knowledge before coming to museum is somewhat strange and unreasonable. 
8. Try to make use of the interactive potential of our products
9. Think about how to let the visitor understand the game and principles more clearly
10. The relationship between our product and emotions is too simple

In the next meeting, we will optimize our product from these aspects.

### 18/04/2018 Group meeting (the improved idea)

In this group meeting, we selected the most important points to discussn: the personality of exhibits, and emotional connections.

In our prototype, the factors affecting the emotion of the exhibits are only the scores of the visitors. Indeed, our previous understanding of the emotions of exhibits was too simple. In designing, we only considered the effects of visitors’ preknowledge on the emotions of exhibits, but in fact there are many other factors that affect the mood of products.

Therefore, we changed the content of the game to increase the factors that affect the emotions of the exhibits, and we will focus on reflecting the personality of the exhibits.

First of all, we intend to pick two different exhibits in the house, giving these two items distinct personalities, such as arrogant paintings and modest kits.

This game will be presented in the form of communication between visitors and the exhibit. The different personalities of different exhibits will be presented in a different tone in the dialogue.

At the beginning of the game, the exhibits will introduce their background knowledge, and then ask the visitor whether they have any previous knowledge about it. If the visitor responds yes, a light will be on after the visitor completes the game. Because the visitor's preknowledge can make visitors better understand this exhibit.

Subsequently, the exhibits will ask whether the visitor is interested in it. If the visitor responds yes, the exhibit will be pleased. After the visitor completes the game, a light will be turned on. At the same time, the visitor can continue to play the next game. If the visitor is not interested in the exhibits, the exhibits will be disappointed and the game will be terminated, because the visitor's love of the exhibits will also affect the mood of the exhibits.

Finally, the visitor will choose the frame that best suits our exhibits (a painting). If the visitor selects the original frame of the painting, it proves that the visitor has the same taste as the original owner of the painting, and will make the exhibits happy.

Finally, at the end of the game, the system will count how many lights the visitor can light for them and light up the corresponding lights in the emotional display area.

### 23/04/2018 Group meeting

In the past few days, we have focused on finding suitable exhibits and designed the personality of exhibits. We intend to let visitors communicate with the exhibit in our game, and to demonstrate the personality of the exhibit in the dialogue.
Here's a dialogue we designed:

Hey, I’m a bit upset right now. Come and try to light me up by touching the screen. I would be happier than before!

### 06/05/2018 Group meeting

We mainly discussed how to make videos today. We plan to use some of the photographs of THE GEORGIAN HOUSE and THE HILL HOUSE, the video of the process, the video of the visitor's playing, and related photos to make the video.

This draft will be utilized in making the video:

 “For some people, going to a museum is a deep and fulfilling experience. However, for others, it's worse than watching paint dry. It's literally watching dried paint.” 

3Main problems in today’s museum are:

It’s not fun enough because of few interactivities between exhibits and visitors. 
Visitors can’t explore it independently because the experience is largely depended on guides' storytelling skills. 
People find it hard to feel connected with exhibits and artworks because they hardly engage. 


HOW TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION?

We came up with corresponding solutions to improve entire engagement. The first on is to apply gamification to improve interactivity.  

Secondly, we try to attach personality to different exhibits to enrich storylines. Besides, we Use “exhibit’s emotion” to help people emphasize and feel reconnected with them.

Attach personality and emotion to exhibits

Based on above, a magical display table was finally born. We invented an interactive tabletop game which can test visitors’ preknowledge and interest for specific objects. During the game different objects chat with you in their own tone.

Their emotion status is presented by LEDs on table, sometimes they keep flashing for your nice answer, sometimes they behave like breathing lights to show their frustration. We collected people’s responses, gave them score, and marked their results by lighting up LEDs. The more lights on, happier the exhibit will be. Lights color will also change from red to green based on its emotion status. 

What we want to express by this is that every visitor can make contribution for its happiness. Exhibits are grateful for each visitor’s presence, they can feel people’s care, interest, appreciation and they want to emotionally connect with you as much as you do.

### 07/05/2018 SOME PICTURES FROM PUBLIC SHOW

In addition to these photos, we also recorded a lot of videos which will be clipped into our formal video.
Here are those photos：
