02.28 Design with Data Meeting
Tutor's thought about our project:
1.	The timetable is unrealistic and it need to be rescheduled
2.	The product should be practical and meaningful

What we should do:
1.	Go to the museum and have a look
2.	Do more research about exhibition or museum and collect relevant information.
3.	Post our idea and relevant material in the blog.
4.	Start thinking about the exhibition stand.

Some inspiration:
1.	We should collect our own data, but do not need to collect data inside the    
museum.
2.  Consider that we may not be able to display inside the museum.
3.  Refer to cycle counters and think about how people will use out product.
4.  Try to be the object and think about how they feel. Find something stronger   
    to support our emotion part.

Next Meeting: Tuesday 6TH March 1:00pm in Evolution House
Mission should be done before the next meeting:
1.	By that time, all research (visual, functional, interactive, emotional, exhibit, museum interaction) should be done.
2.	Everyone should produce 2 concepts relevant to the original one before having a meeting to choose the best 3 concepts.

Besides, we should finish the prototype by 13th March.
