description: Speech Signal Analysis for ASR。
---  

## Speech production model  
p1  
## A/D conversion — Sampling  
Convert analogue signals(模拟信号) in digital form  
p2  
Things to know:  
- Sampling Frequency ($$F_s = 1/T_s$$)
p3  
- Analogue low-pass filtering to avoid ’aliasing’(混淆)  
NB: the cut-off frequency should be less than the *Nyquist frequency* ($$= F_s/2$$)  

## Acoustic Features for ASR
p4  
Speech signal analysis to produce a sequence of acoustic feature vectors.  
### Desirable characteristics of acoustic features used for ASR:  
- Features should contain sufficient information to distinguish between phones.  
  - good time resolution (10ms)  
  - good frequency resolution (20 ∼ 40 channels)  
- Be separated from $$F_0$$ and its harmonics(谐波)  
- Be robust against speaker variation(变异)
- Be robust against noise or channel distortions(扭曲)
- Have good “pattern recognition characteristics”
  - low feature dimension
  - features are independent of each other (NB: this applies to GMMs, but not required for NN-based systems)
