## Speech production model

## A/D conversion — Sampling  
Convert analogue signals(模拟信号) in digital form

Things to know:  
- Sampling Frequency ($$F_s = 1/T_s$$)
![loading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiyou720/zhiyou720.github.io/master/img/ASR/ASR-02-03.png)  
- Analogue low-pass filtering to avoid ’aliasing’(混淆)  
NB: the cut-off frequency should be less than the *Nyquist frequency* ($$= F_s/2$$)  

## Acoustic Features for ASR
![loading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiyou720/zhiyou720.github.io/master/img/ASR/ASR-02-04.png)  
Speech signal analysis to produce a sequence of acoustic feature vectors.  
### Desirable characteristics of acoustic features used for ASR:  
- Features should contain sufficient information to distinguish between phones.  
  - good time resolution (10ms)  
  - good frequency resolution (20 ∼ 40 channels)  
- Be separated from $$F_0$$ and its harmonics(谐波)  
- Be robust against speaker variation(变异)
- Be robust against noise or channel distortions(扭曲)
- Have good “pattern recognition characteristics”
  - low feature dimension
  - features are independent of each other (NB: this applies to GMMs, but not required for NN-based systems)

## Pre-emphasis and spectral tilt(频谱倾斜)
- Pre-emphasis increases the magnitude(量级) of higher frequencies in the speech signal compared with lower frequencies.
- *Spectral Tilt* 
  - The speech signal has more energy at low frequencies (for voiced speech).
  - This is due to the glottal(声门发声的) source (see the figure)
- Pre-emphasis (first-order) filter boosts higher frequencies:
  - $$x'[t_d]=x[t_d]-\alpha x [t_d-1] \quad \quad 0.95<\alpha<0.99$$

## Windowing  
- The speech signal is constantly changing (non-stationary(静止)).  
- Signal processing algorithms usually assume that the signal is stationary  
- Piecewise(分段) stationarity: model speech signal as a sequence of frames (each assumed to be stationary)
- *Windowing*: multiply the full waveform $$s[n]$$ by a window $$w[n]$$ (in time domain):    
<center>$$x[n] = w[n]s[n] \quad\quad (x_t[n] = w[n]x'[t_d+n])$$</center>  
- Simply cutting out a short segment(分段) (frame) from $$s[n]$$ is a rectangular(矩形) window — causes discontinuities at the edges of the segment.  
- Instead, a tapered(锥形的) window is usually used.  
  - e.g. *Hamming* ($$\alpha$$ = 0.46164) or *Hanning* ($$\alpha$$ = 0.5) window
<center>$$w[n] = (1−\alpha) − \alpha cos(\frac{2\pi n}{L-1}) \quad\quad L : window\quad width$$</center>

### Windowing and spectral analysis(频谱分析)
- Window the signal $$x‘[t_d]$$ into frames $$x_t[n]$$ and apply Fourier Transform(傅立叶变换) to each segment.   
  - Short frame width: wide-band, high time resolution(分辨率), low frequency resolution
  - Long frame width: narrow-band, low time resolution, high frequency resolution
- For ASR:
  - frame width ∼ 25ms
  - frame shift ∼ 10ms

## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)(离散傅立叶变换)
- Purpose: extracts spectral information from a windowed signal (i.e. how much energy at each frequency band)
- Input: windowed signal $$x[0], . . . , x[L−1]$$ (time domain)
- Output: a complex number $$X[k]$$ for each of N frequency bands representing magnitude and phase(相位) for the $$k_th$$ frequency component (frequency domain)
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):  
<center>$$ X[k] =\sum^{N-1}_{n=0} x[n] exp(-j\frac{2\pi}{N} kn)$$</center>  
<p align="right">NB: $$exp(j\theta) = e^{j\theta} = cos(\theta) + j sin(\theta)</p>  
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)(快速傅立叶变换) — efficient algorithm for computing DFT when $$N$$ is a power of 2, and $$N \geq L$$
