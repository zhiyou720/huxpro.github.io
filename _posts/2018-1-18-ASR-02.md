---  

## Speech production model  
p1  
## A/D conversion — Sampling  
Convert analogue signals(模拟信号) in digital form  
p2  
Things to know:  
- Sampling Frequency ($$F_s = 1/T_s$$)
p3  
- Analogue low-pass filtering to avoid ’aliasing’(混淆)  
NB: the cut-off frequency should be less than the *Nyquist frequency* ($$= F_s/2$$)
