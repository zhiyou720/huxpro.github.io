## Speech production model

## A/D conversion — Sampling  
Convert analogue signals(模拟信号) in digital form  
p2  
Things to know:  
- Sampling Frequency ($$F_s = 1/T_s$$)
p3  
- Analogue low-pass filtering to avoid ’aliasing’(混淆)  
NB: the cut-off frequency should be less than the *Nyquist frequency* ($$= F_s/2$$)  

## Acoustic Features for ASR
p4  
Speech signal analysis to produce a sequence of acoustic feature vectors.  
### Desirable characteristics of acoustic features used for ASR:  
- Features should contain sufficient information to distinguish between phones.  
  - good time resolution (10ms)  
  - good frequency resolution (20 ∼ 40 channels)  
- Be separated from $$F_0$$ and its harmonics(谐波)  
- Be robust against speaker variation(变异)
- Be robust against noise or channel distortions(扭曲)
- Have good “pattern recognition characteristics”
  - low feature dimension
  - features are independent of each other (NB: this applies to GMMs, but not required for NN-based systems)
## MFCC-based front end for ASR

## Pre-emphasis and spectral tilt(频谱倾斜)
- Pre-emphasis increases the magnitude(量级) of higher frequencies in the speech signal compared with lower frequencies.
- *Spectral Tilt* 
  - The speech signal has more energy at low frequencies (for voiced speech).
  - This is due to the glottal(声门发声的) source (see the figure)
- Pre-emphasis (first-order) filter boosts higher frequencies:
  - $$x'[t_d]=x[t_d]-\alpha x [t_d-1] \quad \quad 0.95<\alpha<0.99$$

## Windowing  
- The speech signal is constantly changing (non-stationary(静止)).  
- Signal processing algorithms usually assume that the signal is stationary  
- Piecewise(分段) stationarity: model speech signal as a sequence of frames (each assumed to be stationary)
- *Windowing*: multiply the full waveform $$s[n]$$ by a window $$w[n]$$ (in time domain):    
<center>$$x[n] = w[n]s[n] \quad\quad (x_t[n] = w[n]x'[t_d+n])$$</center>  
- Simply cutting out a short segment(分段) (frame) from $$s[n]$$ is a rectangular(矩形) window — causes discontinuities at the edges of the segment.  
- Instead, a tapered(锥形的) window is usually used.  
  - e.g. *Hamming* ($$\alpha$$ = 0.46164) or *Hanning* ($$\alpha$$ = 0.5) window
<center>$$w[n] = (1−\alpha) − \alpha cos(\frac{2\pi n}{L-1}) \quad\quad L : window\quadwidth$$</center>

### Windowing and spectral analysis(频谱分析)
- Window the signal $$x‘[t_d]$$ into frames $$x_t[n]$$ and apply Fourier Transform(傅立叶变换) to each segment.   
  - Short frame width: wide-band, high time resolution(分辨率), low frequency resolution
  - Long frame width: narrow-band, low time resolution, high frequency resolution
- For ASR:
  - frame width ∼ 25ms  
  - frame shift ∼ 10ms
