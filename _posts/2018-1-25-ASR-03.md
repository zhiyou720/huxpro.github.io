# Fundamental Equation of Statistical Speech Recognition

If $$X$$ is the sequence of acoustic feature vectors (observations) and $$W$$ denotes a word sequence, the most likely word sequence $$W*$$ is given by:

$$W* = arg \max_W P(W|X)$$

Applying Bayesâ€™ Theorem:  

$$P(W|X) = \frac{p(X|W) P(W)}{p(X)} \propto p(X|W) P(W)$$ 

$$W* = arg \max_W p(X|W) P(W)$$  

where $$p(X|W)$$ is acoustic model and $$P(W)$$ is language model.NB: $$X$$ is used hereafter to denote the output feature vectors from the signal analysis module rather than DFT spectrum.
