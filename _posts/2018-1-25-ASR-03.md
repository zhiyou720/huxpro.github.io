# Fundamental Equation of Statistical Speech Recognition

If $$X$$ is the sequence of acoustic feature vectors (observations) and $$W$$ denotes a word sequence, the most likely word sequence $$W*$$ is given by:

$$W* = arg \max_W P(W|X)$$

Applying Bayes’ Theorem:  

$$P(W|X) = \frac{p(X|W) P(W)}{p(X)} \propto p(X|W) P(W)$$ 

$$W* = arg \max_W p(X|W) P(W)$$  

where $$p(X\mid W)$$ is acoustic model and $$P(W)$$ is language model.NB: $$X$$ is used hereafter to denote the output feature vectors from the signal analysis module rather than DFT spectrum.

# How to calculate $$p(X_1\mid /s/)$$?

Assume $$x_1, x_2, · · · , x_{T_1}$$ corresponds to phoneme /s/, the conditional probability that we observe the sequence is:

$$p(X_1|/s/) = p(x_1, · · · , x_{T_1}|/s/), x_i = (x_{1i}, · · · , x_{Di})^t \in \mathcal{R}^d$$

We know that HMM can be employed to calculate this. (Viterbi algorithm, Forward / Backward algorithm)  
To grasp the idea of probability calculation, let’s consider an extremely simple case where the length of input sequence is just one ($$T_1 = 1$$), and the dimensionality of $$x$$ is one ($$d = 1$$), so that we don’t need HMM:

$$p(X_1|/s/) −→ p(x_1|/s/)$$

$$p(x|/s/)$$ : conditional probability (conditional probability density function ($$pdf$$) of $$x$$)  
- A Gaussian / normal distribution function could be employed for this:

$$P(x|/s/) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^{2}_ {s} } e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_s)^2}{2\sigma^{2}{s}}}$$
