# Overview

- Key models and algorithms for HMM acoustic models
- Gaussians
- GMMs: Gaussian mixture models
- HMMs: Hidden Markov models
- HMM algorithms
  - Likelihood computation (forward algorithm)
  - Most probable state sequence (Viterbi algorithm)
  - Estimating the parameters (EM algorithm)

# Fundamental Equation of Statistical Speech Recognition

If $$X$$ is the sequence of acoustic feature vectors (observations) and $$W$$ denotes a word sequence, the most likely word sequence $$W*$$ is given by:

$$W* = arg \max_W P(W|X)$$
