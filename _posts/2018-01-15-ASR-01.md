## What is speech recognition?  
### Speech-to-text transcription  
- Transform recorded audio into a sequence of words  
- Just the words, no meaning.... But do need to deal with acoustic ambiguity: “Recognise speech?” or “Wreck a nice beach?” (Same pronunciation words) 
- Speaker diarization（分类）: Who spoke when?  
- Speech recognition: what did they say?  
- Paralinguistic aspects（伴随语言的东西）: how did they say it? (timing, intonation（声调）, voice quality)  
- Speech understanding: what does it mean?  

## So, Why is speech recognition difficult?  
### Variability（可变性） in speech recognition  
#### Several sources of variation:  
- <font color="red">Size</font> Number of word types in vocabulary, perplexity  
- <font color="red">Speaker</font> Tuned for a particular speaker, or speaker-independent? Adaptation to speaker characteristics and accent  
- <font color="red">Acoustic（声学） environment</font> Noise, competing speakers, channel conditions (microphone, phone line, room acoustics)  
- <font color="red">Style</font> Continuously spoken or isolated? Planned monologue（计划好的独白） or spontaneous conversation（自然对话）?

## The "fundamental equation" of speech recognition, and components of a system  
### Fundamental Equation of Statistical Speech Recognition
If $$X$$ is the sequence of acoustic feature vectors (observations) and $$W$$ denotes a word sequence, the most likely word sequence $$W^* $$ is given by:  
<center>$$W^* = arg \max_W P(W | X)$$</center>  

Applying Bayes’ Theorem:
<center>$$P(W | X) = \frac{p(X | W)P(W)}{p(X)} \propto P(X|W)P(W)$$</center>  
<center>$$W^* = arg \max_W P(X|W)P(W)$$</center>  
Where $$P(X|W)$$ is Acoustic model(声学模型); $$P(W)$$ is Language model(语言模型).  
### Speech Recognition Components

Use an acoustic model, language model, and lexicon to obtain the most probable word sequence $$W^* $$ given the observed acoustics $$X$$ :

Representing recorded speech (X)

Represent a recorded utterance as a sequence of feature vectors  
Labelling speech (W)

Labels may be at different levels: words, phones, etc.
Labels may be time-aligned – i.e. the start and end times of an acoustic segment corresponding to a label are known.

## Representing the speech signal  
### Phones and Phonemes
- Phonemes
  - abstract unit defined by linguists based on contrastive role in word meanings (eg “cat” vs “bat”)
  - 40–50 phonemes in English  
- Phones  
  - speech sounds defined by the acoustics  
  - many allophones of the same phoneme (eg /p/ in “pit” and “spit”)  
  - limitless in number  
- Phones are usually used in speech recognition – but no conclusive evidence that they are the basic units in speech recognition  
- Possible alternatives: syllables, automatically derived units, ...  
### The TIMIT corpus (from Jan 2017)  
- TIMIT corpus (1986)—first widely used corpus, still in use  
  - Utterances from 630 North American speakers  
  - Phonetically transcribed, time-aligned  
  - Standard training and test sets, agreed evaluation metric (phone error rate)  
- TIMIT phone recognition - label the audio of a recorded utterance using a sequence of phone symbols  
  - Frame classification – attach a phone label to each frame data  
  - Phone classification – given a segmentation of the audio, attach a phone label to each (multi-frame) segment
  - Phone recognition – supply the sequence of labels corresponding to the recorded utterance
## Evaluating speech recognition (from Jan 2017)  
- How accurate is a speech recognizer?  
- String edit distance
  - Use dynamic programming to align（对齐） the ASR output with a reference transcription
  - Three type of error: insertion, deletion, substitutions（插入，删除，替换）
- Word error rate (WER) sums the three types of error. If there are N words in the reference transcript, and the ASR output has S substitutions, D deletions and I insertions, then:  
<center>$$ WER = \frac{S+D+I}{N} \quad\quad Accuracy=1-WER$$</center>
- For TIMIT, define phone error rate analogously(类似) to word error rate. 
- Speech recognition evaluations: common training and development data, release of new test sets on which different systems may be evaluated using word error rate.
