## What is speech recognition?  
### Speech-to-text transcription  
- Transform recorded audio into a sequence of words  
- Just the words, no meaning.... But do need to deal with acoustic ambiguity: “Recognise speech?” or “Wreck a nice beach?” (Same pronunciation words) 
- Speaker diarization: Who spoke when?  
- Speech recognition: what did they say?  
- Paralinguistic aspects: how did they say it? (timing, intonation, voice quality)  
- Speech understanding: what does it mean?  

## So, Why is speech recognition difficult?  
### Variability in speech recognition  
#### Several sources of variation:  
- <font color="red">Size</font> Number of word types in vocabulary, perplexity  
- <font color="red">Speaker</font> Tuned for a particular speaker, or speaker-independent? Adaptation to speaker characteristics and accent  
- <font color="red">Acoustic environment</font> Noise, competing speakers, channel conditions (microphone, phone line, room acoustics)  
- <font color="red">Style</font> Continuously spoken or isolated? Planned monologue or spontaneous conversation? 

## Hierarchical model for speech recognition

## The "fundamental equation" of speech recognition, and components of a system  
If $$X$$ is the sequence of acoustic feature vectors (observations) and $$W$$ denotes a word sequence, the most likely word sequence $$W^*$$ is given by  
<center>$$W^* = arg \max_W P(W | X)$$</center>  
Applying Bayes’ Theorem:
