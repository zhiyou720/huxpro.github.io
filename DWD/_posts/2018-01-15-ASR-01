## What is speech recognition?  
### Speech-to-text transcription  
- Transform recorded audio into a sequence of words  
- Just the words, no meaning.... But do need to deal with acoustic ambiguity: “Recognise speech?” or “Wreck a nice beach?” (Same pronunciation words) 
- Speaker diarization（分类）: Who spoke when?  
- Speech recognition: what did they say?  
- Paralinguistic aspects（伴随语言的东西）: how did they say it? (timing, intonation（声调）, voice quality)  
- Speech understanding: what does it mean?
